# üß¨ AdaptiveTraitEvolution

Repository for analyzing trait evolution in nektonic and carnivorous species using polynomial regression, Gaussian Process Regression, Approximate Bayesian Computation, and stochastic simulations. This repository contains code and documentation for analyzing the evolution of nektonic and carnivorous species using various statistical and computational methods.
This repository provides a Kotlin-based implementation for analyzing the evolution of traits in nektonic and carnivorous species using empirical and simulated datasets. It supports advanced modeling techniques such as:

- Polynomial Regression
- Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
- Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)
- Stochastic simulations (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck & Brownian motion)

## üìö Project Scope

The empirical datasets analyzed in this study include:
- Trait data for Mediterranean nektonic species (fecundity, longevity)
- Diet and ecological range data for carnivorous species (e.g., body mass, niche breadth)

Synthetic datasets were generated for stochastic modeling components.

## Contents
- `data/`: Processed and raw ecological datasets (only simulated data included due to licensing).
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for modeling and simulations.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- `docs/`: Documentation on methods, model assumptions, and reproducibility steps.
